The Undavalli Caves, a monolithic example of Indian rock-cut architecture and one of the finest testimonials to ancient viswakarma sthapathis, are located in Vijayawada of Guntur district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The caves are located south west of Vijayawada, 22 km north east of Guntur City of Andhra Pradesh. It is one of the centrally protected monuments of national importance.</p>
<p>The Undavalli caves are carved in the Gupta style of rock-cut architecture, dated back to the 4th-5th century CE. Most Gupta emperors were Vaishnavas; Many sculptures of the deity Narasimha, as well as other legends of Vishnu and from the text Ramayana are featured in the caves. These are associated with the Vishnukundina kings of 420–620 CE. These caves are dedicated to Ananta Padmanabha, a form of Vishnu laying upon Shesha. Later Jain and Buddhist monks used these caves as rest houses.</p>
<p>It is an Impressive Four storey rock cut temple with East facing facade of 29m long, 16m wide. There are variation in depth of each floor. The ground floor is an unfinished low pillared hall with 8 pillars and 7 door openings on façade. The first storey accommodates triple shrine at back, each with the pillared hall in front, originally dedicated to the Trinity (Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma).[7]

Sculptures on the walls represent Vaishnava deities. The second storey has a pillared rectangular shrine of Vishnu on a serpent. Sculptures of Shiva and Vaishnava and a few like the Vaishnava Alwars are sculptured later on. The top floor was unfinished with a Triple Shrine. Some of the sculptural specimens are attributed to Chalukyan period. It has 5 meter long statue of Vishnu in reclining position.[8] However, it may be difficult to conclude that the 5 meter long statue is lord Vishnu, because well accepted position of lord Vishnu are one side aligned, closed eyes, four hands, 5 head serpent with female god Shre Devi and Bhudevi. There is no such similarity. So it can be concluded that the statue may be 23rd or 17th tirthankara of jainism Parshvanatha. More particularly, the 8 head serpent in the cave leading to a new topic of research in the respective field.</p>
