Kondapalli Fort, also locally known as Kondapalli Kota and Kondapalli Quilla, lies to the west of Kondapalli in Ibrahimpatnam mandal of NTR district in Andhra Pradesh, India was built by Prolaya Vema Reddy[3][4][5][6] of Reddi Kingdom during the 14th century CE.[7] It was initially built as a leisure place and business center and later served as a military training base for the British rulers. According to some other historians it was built in 1360 CE by Anna Vema Reddy[8] after he captured Kondapalli from Mudigonda Chalukyas, the fort has been home to several dynasties, from the Reddi rulers[9][10] Gajapati dynasty to the Nizam Nawabs, and then the East India Company.</p>

The fort is located to the west of Vijayawada city in the main hill range known as Kondapalli in the Krishna district. The hill range, about 24 kilometres (15 mi) in length, extends between Nandigama and Vijayawada. The forest area in this hill range abounds in a type of lightwood known as 'ponuku' పొనుకు కఱ్ఱ (Gyrocapus jacquini), which is used exclusively for the manufacture of the famous Kondpalli toys.[12] The forest vegetation around Kondapalli fort and the nearby hills are also well known for medicinal plants and trees such as Phyllanthus amarus (Telugu local name "nela usiri" నేల ఉసిరిక చెట్టు), Phyllanthus, Andrographis paniculata (local name: "adavi mirapa" అడవి మిరప or "nelavemu" నేలవేము), Thedlapala (Wrightia tinctoria), Tephrosia purpurea, Albizia amara, Streulia urens and Chloroxylon swetenia.[13] The hill range is mainly made up of charnockites, with some pyroxene granulites, granites, khondalites, pyroxenites and dolerites.</p>

The fort was built in 1360 CE by Anna Vemareddy of the Kondaveedu Reddy dynasty after he captured Kondapalli from Mudigonda Chalaukyas.[15] Then the fort was conquered by the mighty Gajapati dynasty of Odisha.In the historic struggle for power for the throne of Gajapati dynasty, Hamvira Deva had to fight his brother Purushottama Deva, who had succeeded to the throne after their father's death. He sought the help of the Bahmani Sultan in this war. He was successful in defeating his brother and occupied the throne of Gajapati dynasty, in 1472. But in the bargain, he gave Kondapalli and Rajahmundry to the Bahmani Sultan. Subsequently,Purushottama Deva defeated Hamvira in 1476 and occupied the throne of Gajapati. But it is also said that in 1476, a revolution began at Kondapalli when there was famine in the Bahmani kingdom. The garrison of Kondapalli revolted and gave possession of the fort to "Hamer Oriya" or Hamvira.</p>
