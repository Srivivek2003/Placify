Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam, is a Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam Hill Range,which is 300 metres above the sea level in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple's legend, Vishnu manifested in this form (lion's head and human body) after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu.Except on Akshaya Trutiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a linga. The temple was built in Kalingan architecture styles and stands unique in the historical region of Kalinga.The Present temple was built by Eastern Ganga king Narasingha Deva I in the 13th century and consecrated by his son Bhanudeva I in 1268 AD.[1] [2] The temple was built by Akthayi Senapathi, on the command of Narasingha Deva I.</p>
<p>
Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and Jagannath Temple, Puri. The earliest inscription at the temple belongs to 11th-century CE recording the gift by a private individual in the era of Chola Chalukya king Kulottunga Chola, son of Raja Raja Narendra of Rajamahendravaram. The second earliest inscription is a donation of Eastern Ganga Dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of Kalinga who conquered Utkala(odisha) and ruled from Ganga to Godavari. </p>
<p>
The Sthala Purana (local legend) of Simhachalam consists of 32 chapters; the number denotes the manifestations of Narasimha.[7] According to Dr. V. C. Krishnamacharyulu, the legends of Simhachalam and other Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh were written in the 14th century after the attempted establishment of Islam in the region.[7] He added that the writers wrote the legends inspired from the stories of Narasimha available in the Hindu puranas.[7] Hence, Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana form the major sources.[8] However, the legend of Simhachalam provides new information about the previous life of the temple's founder Prahlada.[8] The first four chapters of the legend cover the importance of Simhachalam, its deity and the principal water body Gangadhara.</p>
<p>
In the 11th century AD, after winning a debate at the Puri Jagannath temple, Vaishnavite saint and philosopher Ramanuja visited Srikurmam and Simhachalam temples.[17] Simhachalam's deity was believed to be Shiva due to some reasons. The notable ones were the unusual position of the deity's idol, the gate at the lower terrain named Bhairava Dwaram, and the second temple tank being referred to with the name Gangadhara.[18] The annual celebration of Kamadahana, a tradition usually observed in Shiva's temples, was practiced here which added strength to the beliefs</p>
<p>
Simhachalam temple has a past of nearly a thousand years.[22] Epigraphists discovered nearly 500 inscriptions in the temple complex.[23] Almost all of them were dana sasanas (donation records) which referred to the contributions made by the kings, their officers, and the citizens.[24] Majority of the inscriptions are bilingual, written in Sanskrit and Telugu languages. While some are exclusively in Sanskrit, there are 46 Odia and three Tamil language inscriptions.[25] As per the common acceptance of historians, Simhachalam temple has been recognised in the 11th century CE due to an inscription by the Chola king Kulottunga I.[26] The earliest inscription discovered in the temple, it belonged to the 11th century and was dated to 1087 CE.[27] It recorded the gift of a garden by a private individual.[28] The temple functioned well during this period and received liberal patronage from the Later Cholas.</p>
<p>
The temple is situated on Simhachalam Hill Range 800 metres (2,600 ft) above the sea level at a distance of ten miles to the north of Visakhapatnam. The hill range is a part of the Eastern Ghats and is named Kailasa.[40] It is situated on the top of the northern side of the hill in an amphitheatre like structure.[41] The height of the temple is nearly 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) above the sea level.[40] A natural valley is seen running along the north western slope of the hill, which covers almost half of its height.[40] The hill range, cut into terraces, was used later to cultivate large plantations of pineapple, jack fruit, and Banana. A small village grew around the temple in due course of time.[42] Steps were built alongside the stream of water to serve as a way of approach to both the village and the temple.</p>
<p>
Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three prakarams (outer courtyards) and five gateways.[43] Majority of the temple's present form is the one rebuilt by Narasimhadeva I.[14] Its architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Kaligan (Odisha), Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, and the Cholas.[6][47] It faces west, an unusual case in the usual tradition of temple architecture. It is believed that the temple initially faced east, but was changed to west due to inexplicable reasons.[43] As per the Hindu texts Purushottama Samhita and the Vishnu Samhita, a temple facing west signifies victory unlike the east ones which denotes prosperity.[43] It is believed that the Gangadhara's flow from the east to the west might be a reason why the temple faces west.[43] A prakaram covers the entire temple with two gateways on the northern and western sides.</p>
<p>
The moolavirat of Varaha Narasimha is kept in a separate hall named Prahlada mandapa.[51] In its original form, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is two and a half feet tall.[14] The deity stands in a tribhanga posture with a boar's head, a human torso and a lion's tail.[51] On either side of the deity, the idols of Sridevi and Bhudevi holding lotus flowers are seen.[51] The sculpture of Varaha Narasimha has no ornaments and drapery carved on the body. Its limbs and face are disfigured due to vandalism.[51] The moolavar is covered with sandalwood paste imported from Srivilliputhur, Tamil Nadu.[52] After application of the sandalwood paste, the moolavar resembles a four feet tall Shiva Lingam.[13][52] There is enough space for the devotees to offer pradakshinas (circumambulations) to the deity inside the Prahlada mandapa.[45] There are only four main ornaments used in the temple: a Thirunamam made of diamonds and rubies, a chain of emeralds, a 100-tola gold bracelet, and a golden crown.</p>
<p>
The staff of the temple is divided into three groups: the ones involved in religious duties, those who help in preparations for worship, and the administration and supervision related personnel.[56] The Parikshagar and the Sthanapati (or Sthanacharya) were the biggest dignitaries of the temple. These two posts were held by the family members of the Tirumala Peddinti family.[57] At a later point, due to reluctance of the family members, the office of the Sthanapati was merged with that of the Parikshagar.[58] The main duty of a Parikshagar was to ensure that all the daily and special rituals were being conducted in accordance with the injunctions of the past.[57] On the other hand, the Sthanapati used to initiate every proceeding on the temple and served as the representative of the trustees.[58] At present, the temple is maintained and administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam board, which is under the purview of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
